## Introduction
The game is a 2D side scrolling system, where a player moves left, right, vertically or diagonally to traverse the game. there is a level system, although not complete as of yet. This was a semester project, so i had to create the whole game without any game making software or java library. so everything was hardcoded and created from scratch. the player is a human character in a sci-fi suit, with arrow-key movements and jumps by the space button. there are enemies as well, tho not yet satisfactorily advanced yet, with a basic AI to follow the player.

There is no HP system as  of yet, so the player dies on contact with the enemy or falling down legdes etc. the ctrl button fires bullets, tho there is a small fault. the player image does not have a gun and there is no shooting animation. all this would have required intensive GIMP or PhotoShop, and i didnt have the time then. the player has a complete sprite sheet animation, meaning that there are a lot of static images looping to create the effect of movement.

### The game has a complete and fully functioning GUI, with dynamic-background menus and responsive buttons.

## HOW TO PLAY

you need to have netbeans IDE installed on your system and your resolution must me 1366x768. i have yet to make an installable executable of the game and make the resolution dynamic so it could be played on any resolution.

Once previous requirements are met, download the entier code in a folder, open netbeans and choose the open project option, and then open the entire folder as a netbeans project. once the project is opened, click the green arrow on the top to run the game.
